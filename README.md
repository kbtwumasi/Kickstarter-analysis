## Overview Of Project

## Analysis And Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Campaigns in July and October had the highest failed campaigns of 50 followed closely by June with a total of 49 projects. Also, the month of February and April and August had rougly the same number of successful campaigns. There  also tend to be more campaigns during the second quarter of the year around the month of May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Campaigns with goals between 1000 and 4999 had the most projects with a successful outcome rate of 73%. However, the campaign with less than 1000 has the highest percentage of success with 76%.  Campaigns with goal funding between 45000 to 49999 had the highest percentage of failed outcome with only one campaign started. None of the campaigns within the goal amounts listed in column A was canceled. For all goals with failed outcome higher than the successful outcomes, goal funding greater than 50000 has the highest failed projects of 10 out of a total of 12 projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The amount of data available for the analysis was a bit challenging making it difficult to identify any wrong entry that could possibly produce error entries and affect the analysis. Also, another challenge was mistakenly deleting data in a cell when copying and also copying and pasting a wrong cell as a formula parameter.
